# What is Typerr?

Typerr is a typing test application that allows the user to make their own typing tests. Typerr was born out of the idea that users could improve their typing skills while also reading about something they care about.

## Create Your Own Typing Tests

To create a new test, open the **Create Test Form** from Home. From here the user can create a new typing test is several ways:

- **From URL:** Copy and Paste any URL containing text data and Typerr will do the rest for you. You are given opportunity to review extracted data before creating the test.
- **From File:** Import any .txt file
- **Manually:** Type out your own test or copy/paste text into the field.

## RSS Subscriptions
In addition to being able to create a typing test from any article, Typerr supports RSS Subscriptions. You can browse RSS feeds within the app and create tests from their attached URLs.

## Typing Test 
Improve your typing accuracy and WPM with Typerr. The primary features of the typing test are:

- **Test Controls:** Pause, resume or stop the test at anytime!
- **Stats:** View your current WPM, time, number of words typed and number of typing errors.
- **Visual Feedback:** Typing errors are indicated in red.
- **No Handrails:** The test does not stop you from typing when you make an error. Errors can be undone by using the Backspace key at the cost of time, or you can continue typing.

## Other Features

- **Test Modes:** There are two test modes, timed and marathon. Timed will automatically end the test after the specified time has elapsed. In marathon mode you have to either complete the test or stop it manually.
- **Preview Dialogs:** Preview data about created tests or RSS feed items.
